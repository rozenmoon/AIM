##### N5 level
This batch is taken by Promod
- Very well handelled by Promod
- Regualer updates on Whatsapp Group
- 23 is batch strength and average class attendece is about 18~20
- We decided to take no money from the studends
- We give 5k to Promod
- Very senser person
- He is handelling class very well

### Descuion
- Students are not willing to pay
- The decision of taking no money from the students were not passed to everyone in the AIM Japan
- Members were not actively involved in the activity so the decision did not reach to them
- We should share the decision
- We should not care if the people are getting connected to AIM, but we are atleast creating influence in the community
- We should not care about credibility
- We are not self initiative
- We should give responsiblity to new members
- Providing scholership to the certain people will create a sense of parrtiality in the people

### Proposal

#### Instead of trying to run a batch of many people, focusing on hanfull of people is better
- We will do classes and if we find potential people we will try

A short summery in the whatsapp should be given
