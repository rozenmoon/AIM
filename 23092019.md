- Major Decipline issue
- Only 3 classes in 2 months were held
- This class was dissolved
- We gave 3000rs to Rupam and ended the classes

##### N5 level
This batch is taken by Promod
- Very well handelled by Promod
- Regualer updates on Whatsapp Group
- 23 is batch strength and average class attendece is about 18~20
- We decided to take no money from the studends
- We give 5k/month to Promod
- Pramod is very sincier person
- He is handelling students and classes very well

### Discussion
- When the advertisement (with fees) for promoting the start for N5 batch was publish very less applications were received
- To get satisfactory no. of applications advertisement was changed to without fees. After this changes no. of applications increased to satisfactory level
- And when during the interview people were asked about fees, People were not willing to pay
- Students are not willing to pay for classes
- The decision of taking no money from the students was not passed to everyone in the AIM Japan
- Members were not actively involved in the activity so the decision did not reach to them
- We should share the decision on Whatsapp
- We should not care if the people are getting connected to AIM, but we are atleast creating influence in the community
- We should not care about credibility
- There is low self initiative among members
- We should give responsiblity to new members
- Providing scholership to the certain people will create a sense of partiality in the people
- Many things are already documented in AIM google drive. We need to make it more accessible and members should go through it

### Problems identified
- All members do not activily participate in the group activity
- Decisions are not passed to eveyone in the group
- Members do not have self intiation
- Conflicts in the ideas among members


### Proposal

#### Instead of trying to run a batch of many people, focusing on hanfull of people is better
- We will do classes and if we find potential people we will try have `individual attension program`

#### A short summery in the whatsapp should be given so that every members will be updated with the decissions
